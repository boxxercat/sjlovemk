/* Re-implementing custom animations used in Tailwind classes if needed, 
   but for now we used standard utility classes mostly. 
   However, we referenced 'animate-fade-in-down' and 'animate-pop' in HTML comments/mental model 
   but Tailwind doesn't have them by default. Let's add them as utility classes via @layer utilities logic 
   OR just keep them as standard classes.
   
   Actually, in the HTML I used 'animate-fade-in-down' which doesn't exist in default Tailwind.
   So I will define the standard CSS class for it here to match the HTML class name, 
   OR I should have added it to tailwind config. 
   
   Let's just use standard CSS classes for these specific animations to keep it simple 
   without over-engineering the tailwind config in the HTML script tag.
